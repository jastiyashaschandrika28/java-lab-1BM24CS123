Write a program that demonstrates handling of exceptions in an inheritance tree. Create a base class called “Father” and derived class called “Son” which extends the base class. In Father class, implement a constructor which takes the age and throws the exception WrongAge( ) when the input age<0. In Son class, implement a constructor that uses both father and son’s age and throws an exception if son’s age is >=father’s age.
